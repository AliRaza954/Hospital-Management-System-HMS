#### For the development of this project following programming languages, frameworks and IDE's were used:

* **For backend;** I used C# and SQL programming languages, C# for structuring the software and SQL for creating a database to store the date.
* **For frontend;** I used WPF Services which uses XAML for creating and designing a more user interactive UI.
* **For framework;** I prefered .NET because of it's enriched libraries in bulding desktop, web, mobile applications.
* **For IDE;** I used Visual Studio Community 2019 version for the development of the project, cause it's easy to use and more understandable UI increases the 'Productivity' and 'Development' of the applications, I also used MySQL for creating the database and then connecting it with my project through Visual Studio Community.

#### Issues:
1. When you clone this project into your local machine, some of you might face a bug/error about `ERROR: Not Connected` or `Database Server Not Found`, then this could might be because of the database connectivity issue, but that can be resolved if you run/connect that sql file through your own database system or IDE.
2. There might be also an issue while logging as the login password for all the user was set to "root" by default but in some cases that might not work and the program might crash. But you can easily change that default password and set it accordingly. 
3. Different windows doesn't contain a background picture at all, but you can add into them accordingly as per you taste and requirement.

#### Ending Note:
 Many appologies for such bugs and errors in the program but they will all be covered in the next version of my HMS software `"HMS" version 2.0`. I'm very sorry that I coudn't resolve them on time. But I give you the assurity that in next version of my HMS will be more convenient to use and and will be bug and error free. Till then stay tune.
